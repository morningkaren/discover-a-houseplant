# discover-a-houseplant

Are you a plant lover? Would you like to discover a new houseplant?
Here is code to scrape data on the most popular houseplants on houseplant411.com and make an app that can recommend
different houseplants to people.

The heart of the recommendation system is a cosine similiarity matrix of the vectors that represents the descriptions of
each houseplant.

The deployed app can be viewed here - https://discover-a-houseplant.herokuapp.com/
